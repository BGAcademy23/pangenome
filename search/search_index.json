In this session you will first get a brief background on the utility of pangenomes, followed by a hands-on tutorial where you will: </p> <ol> <li>construct a pangenome using minigraph and primate mitochondrial genomes </li> <li>visualize and annotate using bandage </li> <li>identify lineage specific differences</li> </ol> <p>By the end of this session, you will have all of the tools necessary to curate your genome assemblies into a functional and dynamic reference graph.</p>"},{"location":"#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>To get the most out of this workshop, participants will have downloaded the requisite programs: minigraph, bandage, as well as the data fasta file of mitochondrial gene transcripts. Experience with GUI point-n-click programs, access and familiarity with terminal and bash command line programming <code>grep, cd, ls ...etc.</code> </p> <p>Please make sure you MEET THE PREREQUISITES and READ THE DESCRIPTION above</p> <p>You will get the most out of this session if you meet the prerequisites above.</p> <p>Please also read the description carefully to see if this session is relevant to you.</p> <p>If you don't meet the prerequisites or change your mind based on the description or are no longer available at the session time, please email tol-training at sanger.ac.uk to cancel your slot so that someone else on the waitlist might attend.</p>"}]}
